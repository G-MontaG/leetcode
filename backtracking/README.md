## Letter Combinations of a Phone Number

3 Keys To Backtracking:

Our choice: At each number we can choose certain letters
Our constraints: none really
Our goal: Get a string as ling as the original number given

Time: `O(4^n) * O(1) * O(n) = O(n(4^n))` [weak upper bound]
Space: `O(n) + O(4^n) = O(4^n)`
