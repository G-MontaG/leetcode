# Linked list

## Delete Node in a Linked List

It goes without saying

## Remove Nth Node From End of List

The standard solution, but without a dummy extra node. Instead, I simply handle the special case of removing the head right after the fast cursor got its head start

Best way to understand solution is walk through the algorithm using the lists you wrote down and change the values or arrows as the algorithm changes them
