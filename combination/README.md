# Combination

In mathematics, a combination is a selection of items from a collection, such that (unlike permutations) the **order** of selection **does not matter**. For example, given three fruits, say an apple, an orange and a pear, there are three combinations of two that can be drawn from this set: an apple and a pear; an apple and an orange; or a pear and an orange.
