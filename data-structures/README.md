# Data Structures

### Array

We have array structure in javascript by design.

### Stack

In a stack, the element deleted from the set is the one most recently inserted: the stack implements a last-in, first-out, or LIFO, policy.

Javascript has `push` and `pop` methods, which operate on ordinary Javascript array objects.

### Queue

Similarly, in a queue, the element deleted is always the one that has been in the set for the longest time: the queue implements a first-in, first-out, or FIFO, policy.

Javascript has `push` and `shift` methods, which operate on ordinary Javascript array objects.
