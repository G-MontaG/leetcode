### Binary Tree Preorder Traversal

### Binary Tree Inorder Traversal

### Binary Tree Postorder Traversal

## Binary Tree Level Order Traversal

Solution based on BFS. There are other possible solutions listed in python files, but usually, you should use BSF.

## Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal

Same as level order traversal except reversing odd levels.

## Construct Binary Tree from Traversal

Recursive solution with hashing. Solution has `O(N)` time and extra space.
